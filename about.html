      <div class="history-pharagraph">
        <p>Southern Mindanao Institute of Technology Inc., the first technical school in the province of Sultan Kudarat was founded in 1985. It started with the registration of three hundred (300) students, and housed in a wooden structure, the old Ventura Building in the Municipality of Tacurong. At its onset the courses offered were 1-year Automotive Mechanic Course (AMC), 1-year Diesel Mechanic Course (DMC), 1-year Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Course (RAC); 2-year Radio Technician and Television Course (RTTV); Industrial Electricity Course (IE); 2-year General Radio Communication (GRCO); and 2-year Hotel and Restaurant Management Course (HRM).
        <br>
        <br>
        The following year, 1986, to accommodate the growing population of enrollee, SMIT moved to Sandoval Building, along National Highway, fronting Tacurong Fitmart. And in 1987, the 4-year Bachelor of Arts in Mass Communication (ABMC) was opened to become the first baccalaureate degree program.
        <br>
        <br>
        Like any other organizations conflict in the implementation of policies and operations, especially among the Board of Trustees arose, as such in 1988, a new president was installed.
        <br>
        <br>
        The new President in his desire for change, introduced purpose and direction which some vehemently objected
        <br>
        <br>
        The school years from 1994 to 1995 despite the decrease in the number of students to almost half of its original three hundred and despite the desire of some trustees to close down,  the resolute will of a quiet, compassionate trustee, Mr. Federico S. Señeres, Sr. a retired member of the Philippine Army, prevailed
        <br>
        <br>
        Mr. Señeres, Sr., the man of few words, deeply moved by the plight of youth aspiring for education, but coming from the poor and middle class families endeavored to go against all odds to see the floundering institution rise, like a mythical phoenix, to emerge, as an unbeatable and worthy learning institution in the Province of Sultan Kudarat.
        <br>
        <br>
        Through his guiding spirit, with the support of his hardworking and loving wife, Mrs. Josephine S. Señeres, together they have built and developed SMIT to what it is now. They alone, with just a handful of optimistic and loyal staff have unflichingly created a portal for learning, many graduates proudly claim as their alma mater.
        <br>
        <br>
        Worthy of mention are stalwarts of SMIT, Engr. Ernesto A. Nachon, Mr. Lorenzo B. Ysulat., Mr. Arnel V. Ardaniel and Ms. Elizabeth C. Samaniego.
        <br>
        <br>
        In 1995, additional TESDA Programs were offered, such as, the 2-year Office Management (OM) and 2-year Computer Technology Course (Comp. Tech); hence the need to attract more teaching staff and administrative personnel.
        <br>
        <br>
        Because of the philanthropic and sincere corporate social responsibility it is no wonder, the Señeres couple has been blessed. Divine Providence light their way to achieve their objective of helping poor but deserving students, so much so that in 1996, Mr. And Mrs. Señeres were able to acquire a permanent and wide location for the growing school, a 1 3/4 hectare prime lot along the National Highway, Tacurong, Sultan Kudarat.
        <br>
        <br>
        At first, a five classroom structure was initially constructed to accommodate the growing number of students.
        <br>
        <br>
        Through the passage time, and to accomplish SMIT’s Vision and Mission of delivering excellent and holistic education, effective and efficient teaching force, adequate and appropriate facilities; apart from the four storey building other support infrastructure were constructed by the administration; such as Criminology Building, High School Building, and gymnasium that could accommodate 2,000 students and visitors.
        <br>
        <br>
        Function room was opened to accept bookings for seminars and workshops, conference of local and national government units,  non-government organizations as well as receptions for weddings and birthday celebrations catered by the students of the HRM Department.
        <br>
        <br>
        SMIT, a family owned institution and managed by the Señeres family has at its helm the patriarch, Mr. Federico Señeres, Sr. as President, Mr. Federico S. Señeres, Jr. as Vice President and the kind and motherly Mrs. Josephine S. Señeres as Treasurer and Registrar.
        <br>
        <br>
        The family’s being self directed , is sincere in their commitment to improve the quality of education of the youth of Sultan Kudarat and nearby provinces, SMIT continues to grow with its property acquisitions and successful graduates, the family and school have gained undeniable integrity and credibility.
        <br>
        <br>
        As such, banking institution have continuously offered loans to finance the construction of more school infrastructures like the SMIT Business Center.
        On September 28, 2015 in celebration of the 30th Foundation Anniversary and Intramurals and natal day of Mr. Federico S. Señeres, Sr., another (3) storey building was inaugurated. This edifice was financed by Land Bank of the Philippines amounting to twenty million (Php20,000,000.00) pesos. In the making, the construction of the said building was supervised by the school president himself just like what he did in other buildings within the campus. The building has twenty four (24) classrooms and has been designated for the K-12 program to start this school year 2016-2017.
